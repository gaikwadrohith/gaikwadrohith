## Hey there! 👋

I’m **Rohit**, a **Computer Science Engineering graduate (2025)** with a strong respect for fundamentals and a growing passion for building clean, reliable software.

I enjoy turning ideas into practical applications and understanding how systems work beneath the surface. If something sparks my curiosity, chances are I’ll try to build it, break it, and rebuild it better.

My main focus areas include **Java, full-stack web development, and problem-solving**. I value clear structure, readable code, and real-world usability over shortcuts and noise.

I’ve been working on projects ranging from **web applications** to **core Java and security-based concepts**, and I’m continuously improving one step at a time.

If you’re interested in learning, building, or collaborating—feel free to explore my repositories.

**Fun facts:**
- I believe strong fundamentals beat flashy shortcuts ⚙️  
- I enjoy building things step by step 🚀  
- Learning by doing is my default mode 🧠
