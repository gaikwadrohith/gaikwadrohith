## Hey there 👋

I’m **Rohit**, a **Computer Science Engineering graduate (2025)** focused on building clean, reliable software with strong fundamentals.

I mostly work on **Java and full-stack web development**, with an interest in backend systems, problem-solving, and writing clear, maintainable code.

This is a growing profile where I’ll be uploading **projects, experiments, and things I’m actively working on**. Everything here is built step by step with intent—no rushed code, no noise.
